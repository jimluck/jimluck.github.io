            <h2>What is My Hobby?</h2>
            <p>At its heart, my hobby is an expression of worship and service, a way to connect deeply with my faith and share this connection with others. Through music, technology, and community involvement, I seek to create moments where the presence of the Lord is felt and celebrated.</p>
            <p>Whether it's leading a song of praise, ensuring the church's audiovisual needs are met, or organizing events that bring our community together, each act is a piece of a larger tapestry of devotion.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I am a person of faith, called to serve and worship. My journey is one of continuous learning and sharing, where each day offers a new opportunity to express my love for God through service.</p>
            <p>My roles in the church are many, from technical support for our worship services to leading prayer groups, each allowing me to use my skills for the greater glory of God.</p>

        <section id="when" class="hobby-section" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Service Times</h2>
            <p>Our church gathers several times a week, each meeting serving as a cornerstone for our community's spiritual life. Our rhythm of worship includes Sunday afternoon services, Tuesday Bible studies, Saturday evening intercessory prayers, and special events. </p>
            <p>These gatherings are not just about being in church; they're about creating a community of faith that supports and uplifts each other on our spiritual journeys.</p>

            <h2>Sacred Spaces</h2>
            <p>The church is our primary sacred space, a place where we gather to worship and connect with God. However, our sense of community extends beyond its walls, reaching into our homes and online spaces, where we continue to share our faith.</p>
            <p>In these sacred spaces, we find comfort, guidance, and a sense of belonging, all essential elements of our spiritual lives.</p>

        <section id="how" class="hobby-section" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Ways of Worship</h2>
            <p>Worship takes many forms, from the songs we sing to the sermons we heed. It's in the way we set up each chair, tune every instrument, and welcome every soul through our doors.</p>
            <p>My service is a blend of artistry and technical skill, aimed at facilitating an environment where every attendee can feel the presence of God and engage fully in worship.</p>

        <section id="why" class="hobby-section" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Faith and Dedication</h2>
            <p>Serving the Lord is more than a hobby; it's a calling that resonates with the core of my being. It's rooted in a deep faith and a heartfelt desire to make a difference in the world around me. Through service, I express my gratitude for the grace and blessings I've received and share those blessings with others.</p>
            <p>This path of service is a reflection of my commitment to live out the teachings of Jesus Christ, to love my neighbor as myself, and to be a light in the darkness. Each act of service, no matter how small, is a step towards fulfilling that mission.</p>
